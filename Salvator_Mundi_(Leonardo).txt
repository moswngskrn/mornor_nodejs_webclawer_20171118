Salvator Mundi is a painting of Christ as Salvator Mundi (Saviour of The World) from c. 1500, which has been attributed by leading scholars as a work by Leonardo da Vinci since its rediscovery in 2005.[1] This attribution has been disputed by other specialists.[2] Long thought lost, it was restored and then exhibited in 2011. The painting shows Christ, in Renaissance dress, giving a benediction with his raised right hand and crossed fingers while holding a crystal sphere in his left hand.[3] The painting was sold at auction by Christie's in New York, on 15 November 2017, for $450.3 million, setting a new mark for most expensive painting ever sold.Leonardo da Vinci's Salvator Mundi was possibly painted for Louis XII of France and his consort, Anne of Brittany. It was probably commissioned shortly after the conquests of Milan and Genoa around 1500.[4][5]It was subsequently owned by Charles I of England and recorded in his art collection in 1649 before being auctioned by the son of the Duke of Buckingham and Normanby in 1763. It next appeared in 1900, when it was purchased by a British collector, Francis Cook, 1st Viscount of Monserrate. The painting was damaged from previous restoration attempts, and its authorship unclear. Cook's descendants sold it at auction in 1958 for £45.[3]In 2005, the painting was acquired for less than $10,000 (8,450 euros) at an estate sale by a consortium of art dealers that included Robert Simon, a specialist in Old Masters.[6] It had been heavily overpainted so it looked like a copy, and was, before restoration, described as "a wreck, dark and gloomy".[7] In 2013, the painting was sold to Russian collector Dmitry Rybolovlev for US$127.5 million, via the Swiss dealer Yves Bouvier.[8][9][10]It was sold at auction at Christie's in New York in November 2017 for $450,312,500, a new record price for an artwork (hammer price $400 million plus $50.3 million in fees).[11][12] The purchaser was not disclosed.[13][14] The new record selling price was 50% higher than the previous record for a painting.[15][16]The consortium of art dealers believed there was a possibility that the low quality mess (with its excessive overpainting) might actually be the long missing da Vinci original. They spent the next few years having the painting restored and authenticated as a painting by Leonardo.[7]Once it was cleaned and restored, the painting was compared with, and found superior to, twenty other versions of Salvator Mundi. It was exhibited by London's National Gallery during the Leonardo da Vinci: Painter at the Court of Milan from November 2011 to February 2012.[7][17][18][4] Several features in the painting have led to the positive attribution: a number of pentimenti are evident, most notably the position of the right thumb. The sfumato effect of the face—evidently achieved in part by manipulating the paint using the heel of the hand—is typical of many Leonardo works.[19] The way the ringlets of hair and the knotwork across the stole have been handled is also seen as indicative of Leonardo's style. Furthermore, the pigments and the walnut panel upon which the work was executed are consistent with other Leonardo paintings.[20] Additionally, the hands in the painting are very detailed, something that Leonardo is known for: he would dissect the limbs of the deceased in order to study them and render body parts in an extremely lifelike manner.[21]One of[22] the world's leading Leonardo experts Martin Kemp,[23] who helped authenticate the work, said that he knew immediately upon first viewing the restored painting that it was the work of Leonardo: "It had that kind of presence that Leonardos have ... that uncanny strangeness that the later Leonardo paintings manifest."[19]Walter Isaacson in his biography of Leonardo wrote that the orb that Christ is holding does not correspond to the way an orb would realistically look:In one respect, it is rendered with beautiful scientific precision, but Leonardo failed to paint the distortion that would occur when looking through a solid clear orb at objects that are not touching the orb. Solid glass or crystal, whether shaped like an orb or a lens, produces magnified, inverted, and reversed images. Instead, Leonardo painted the orb as if it were a hollow glass bubble that does not refract or distort the light passing through it.[24]Isaacson believes that this was "a conscious decision on Leonardo's part",[25] and speculates that either Leonardo felt a more accurate portrayal would be distracting, or "he was subtly trying to impart a miraculous quality to Christ and his orb".[24]Kemp, on the other hand, says the doubled outline of the heel of the hand holding the sphere—which the restorer described as a pentimento—is an accurate rendering of the refraction produced by a calcite sphere.[19]There are also some who question the attribution of the painting to Leonardo.[26][25] Michael Daley, the director of ArtWatchUK, raised doubts on the authenticity of the painting.[27] He noted that there is practically no evidence that proves that Leonardo was ever involved in painting a Salvator Mundi subject; thus disputing the important argument in favor of attributing the painting to Leonardo, namely that the painting contains pentimenti and for that reason has to be attributed to Leonardo himself.[28][27] Daley notes on the Salvator Mundi painting being the prototype of a subject painted by Leonardo: "This quest for an autograph prototype Leonardo painting might seem moot or vain: not only do the two drapery studies comprise the only accepted Leonardo material that might be associated with the group, but within the Leonardo literature there is no documentary record of the artist ever having been involved in such a painting project."[27][29]Jacques Franck, a Paris-based art historian and Leonardo specialist, who reviewed the piece out of the frame multiple times, stated: "The composition doesn't come from Leonardo, he preferred twisted movement. It's a good studio work with a little Leonardo at best."[30]Dr. Carmen Bambach, specialist in Italian Renaissance art at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, questioned full attribution to Leonardo: "having studied and followed the picture during its conservation treatment, and seeing it in context in the [National Gallery] exhibition, much of the original painting surface may be by Boltraffio, but with passages done by Leonardo himself, namely Christ's proper right blessing hand, portions of the sleeve, his left hand and the crystal orb he holds."[31][32]Professor Charles Hope, art historian, writes: "I’m not a believer that this is a real Leonardo... I think it’s exceptionally boring, and when you see it hanging next to some real Leonardos, it doesn’t look good. Frankly, I think the claim that it’s a Leonardo is ridiculous. Nobody in their right mind would think it was. The world is filled with near-Leonardos."[31][33]Contemporary copy by Cesare da Sesto (1516–17), Wilanów Palace, WarsawSchool of Leonardo da Vinci, Salvator Mundi (1503), Museo Diocesano, NapoliEtching by Wenceslaus Hollar (1607–1677), including the artist’s inscription in Latin, Leonardus da Vinci pinxit, Thomas Fisher Rare Book Library, University of Toronto[34]Anonymous Flemish artist (c. 1750–75), Museum of Fine Arts, Houston
